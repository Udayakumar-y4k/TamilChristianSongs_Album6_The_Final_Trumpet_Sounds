This song of humble pursuit echoes Job 28:12–28 (“But where shall wisdom be found?… The fear of the Lord, that is wisdom”) and Proverbs 3:13–18 (“She [wisdom] is more precious than jewels”). It proclaims that true wisdom is not found in riches, nature, or human effort — only in fearing the Lord and walking in His ways. The song calls the remnant to seek God’s holy wisdom above all earthly treasures, shun evil, and let His light reign in heart and life — for Christ is the wisdom of God (1 Corinthians 1:24, 30).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, Wisdom of God and Light of the world,
more precious than pearls is Your holy wisdom.
Grant us hearts that fear You and shun evil.
Let us seek Your truth above all treasures.
Fill us with Your light and guide our steps in purity.
Come quickly, and let Your eternal wisdom reign in every seeking soul.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!

This cry of brokenness and plea for lifting echoes the raw laments of David (Psalm 31:9–10, Psalm 38:1–10, Psalm 6:2–6) and Job (Job 30:16–17) — bones pierced, soul poured out, darkness instead of light. It is the honest prayer of the afflicted soul, yet it turns to Jesus as the only hope. The song calls the remnant to cry out in suffering, knowing God sees the brokenhearted and lifts them (Psalm 34:18). True restoration comes from the Savior who bore our afflictions (Isaiah 53:4–5) and promises to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, who sees every broken soul and hears every cry in the night,
look upon us in our affliction.
Our bones are pierced, our strength fails, our hearts are cast in the mire.
Lift our faces, restore our souls, turn our darkness to light.
Come with healing in Your wings, and let Your grace raise us up.
Hold us until the day You wipe away every tear.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!

This joyful declaration echoes Psalm 1 in full — the blessed man avoids the way of the wicked, delights in the law of the Lord, and meditates on it day and night, becoming like a tree planted by streams of water that yields fruit in season and never withers. The song calls the remnant to reject compromise, delight in Scripture, and bear lasting fruit for God’s glory. True prosperity is not worldly gain but spiritual fruitfulness — rooted in Christ, the living Word (John 1:1), who makes us thrive in every season (John 15:5).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, living Word and Tree of Life,
plant us deep by Your streams of living water.
Let us delight in Your law day and night.
Keep us from the way of the wicked and the seat of scoffers.
Make us fruitful trees that never wither.
Let everything we do prosper in Your will.
Come quickly, and let Your eternal hallelujah resound in every rooted heart.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!

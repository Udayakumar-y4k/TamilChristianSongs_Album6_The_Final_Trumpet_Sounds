This majestic declaration of sonship and authority echoes Psalm 2:7–12 (“You are my Son… Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage… You shall break them with a rod of iron”). It proclaims the believer’s adoption as sons through Christ (Romans 8:15–17, Galatians 4:4–7), the promise of authority over enemies, the call to serve with fear and rejoicing, and the anointing on the holy mountain. The song prepares the remnant for the final trumpet: we are sons and heirs with Christ, called to kiss the Son and stand in His righteousness before the King returns to rule the nations.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, eternal Son of the Father,
thank You for making us Your sons and daughters through Your blood.
Today You have become our Father — we are Yours.
Grant us the nations as our heritage, the ends of the earth as our possession.
Break every enemy with Your rod of iron.
Anoint us on Your holy mountain.
Let us serve You with fear and rejoice with trembling.
Come quickly, and let Your eternal hallelujah resound as every knee bows.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!

This majestic song of awe and humility echoes God’s questions to Job in Job 38 — “Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?” — revealing the Creator’s sovereign power over stars, seas, storms, and time. It calls the listener to stand in wonder at God’s unmatched wisdom and majesty, confessing our smallness and surrendering to the One who formed all things. The song prepares the remnant for the final trumpet: the same God who laid the earth’s foundations will return in glory to judge and reign (Revelation 11:15).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Almighty God, Creator of heavens and earth,
we stand in awe before Your majesty.
Where were we when You spoke the stars into being?
Where were we when You set the boundaries of the sea?
Forgive our pride and smallness.
Let us bow before You in humble wonder.
Come quickly with Your final trumpet, and let Your glory fill all creation.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!

This solemn vow of lifelong devotion echoes Psalm 116:1–2 (“I love the Lord… I will call upon him as long as I live”) and Deuteronomy 6:5 (“Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul”). It calls the believer to love Jesus alone, shun evil, walk blamelessly, cast away pride, and surrender fully at His feet — until the final trumpet sounds and we stand before Him. The song prepares the remnant for the last days: faithful love, righteous living, and eternal surrender to the King.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, worthy of all love and devotion,
as long as breath remains in us, let us love You alone.
Keep our souls resting in Your holy throne.
Guide us on the path of righteousness.
Cast out pride and fill us with Your Spirit.
Let our lives be a living sacrifice to You.
Come quickly, and receive us into Your eternal glory.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!

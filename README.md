# TamilChristianSongs_Album6_The_Final_Trumpet_Sounds
1 Thessalonians 4:16–17 (“For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God…”); 1 Corinthians 15:51–52 (“...at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable…”); Revelation 11:15 (“The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever.”); Matthew 24:31 (He will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call…)
This album will be a solemn yet triumphant announcement — the final trumpet sounding, the dead raised, the King returning, the eternal kingdom established. It is the culmination of all hallelujahs — the trumpet that ends time and begins eternity.
